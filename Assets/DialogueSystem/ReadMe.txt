To Create a conversation, all you have to do is drag the script onto an empty object, and start writing.
For the system to work, there has to be a ConversationManager, and UIConnector to handle and change the text values, and button presses.
To make the current script the active one, simply drag the object with the Convo script onto the slot in the ConversationManager.
If you are having any problems with either setting it up or anything else in general, use the MainScene as a reference or email me at: GrahamAssets@gmail.com
